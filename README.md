# UEDumper
This can probably dump the SDK for any Unreal Engine Game (Educational Purpose Only)
Note: We released this early, for now it's working perfect for fortnite (lower than u4.25?), but we will add more support later!

# Usage
1. Inject the dll into your game
2. If all offsets are found automatically you will need to do nothing, otherwise you will need to get them manually
3. Go to the game path and copy your SDK
4. To use it in a project check out the examples, not all packages are included, just add the ones you need to Core.hpp

# Features
✔️ Dump all Object names  
✔️ Create a SDK  
  
# Details
