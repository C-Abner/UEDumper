# UEDumper
This can probably dump the SDK for any Unreal Engine Game (Educational Purpose Only)
Note: We released this early, for now it's working perfect for fortnite (lower than u4.25?), but we will add more support later!  
Update: Most is now fixed, Core.hpp will be added soon, then it should work fine (will take 1-3 days), offsets finder will also be rewritten to support more games!
